# OlafTherapy

My son's favorite character in the world is Olaf. He's also going to therapy for a brain injury he suffered through when he was born, to try and get him to use the right side of his body more.

This app is a simple and fun way to get him to touch two yellow circles (one with each hand), and reward him with a picture and sound clip of Olaf when he does it.
